# FEUERWASSER Fathom Viewer (frwssr_fathomviewer)
An app to display a [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/) shared dashboard in [PerchCMS](https://grabaperch.com/).

## Installation

1. Download zip archive and extract locally.
2. Create a `frwssr_fathomviewer` folder in the `/perch/addons/apps/` folder of your *Perch* install.
3. Copy the files `_version.php`, `admin.php`, `index.php`, as well as the folders `js` and `lang` (along with their respective contents) to the `/perch/addons/apps/frwssr_fathomviewer` folder.
4. Reload the Perch Admin interface. *Fathom Viewser* should now show in you apps listing on the left.

## Usage
Got to your *Perch* settings page, scroll to the very bottom and fill in at least the ID of the shared site you wish to load.
If the shared dashboard is set to `Private` (in the *Fathom* account), also supply the required password.

### Notes
- If you are seeing an error ‚Äú419 ‚Äì Page Expired‚Äù (with a floating cat), you have most likely not set the password required for this particular dashboard. Add that to the *Fathom Viewer* section at the bottom of the *Perch* settings page. Putting in your password in the iFrame, displaying the *Fathom* dashboard, it will not work.
- This app was developed under Perch (Standard) Version 3.2 on a server running PHP 7.4.25. Most likely it will run below these versions. Nothing fancy going on here.
Anyway: **Use at own risk!**

# Shout-outs
- I snuck a peek or two at *Fathom‚Äôs* own [WordPress integration](https://usefathom.com/docs/integrations/wordpress). So many thanks to Jack and Paul for letting me use their (not so?) secret URL pattern to make the dashboard work with a password here. üôå
- Resizing of the iFrame in the *Fathom Viewer* app is provided by David J. Bradshaw‚Äôs *iFrame Resizer* script. For details please go to [iFrame Resizer‚Äôs GitHub page](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer).
